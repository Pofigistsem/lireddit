How do sessions work??
Order of things:

When we do this: req.session.userId = user.id;
- We are storing some data in the session. What happens behind the scenes:
its going to take any data that we stuck on theis object and its going to save it to redis
For example: {userId: 1} -> send that to redis.
Redis is the key - value store which means that you have a key to look up values.


1.
A key may look like something like this: 
    sess:qweqoeiqeqwi -> { userId: 1 }
so - sess is a key and has userId data stored.

If i give redis this key, it will give us this data.

2.
expresss-session will set a cookie on my browser wqeuq9eu12786euiqwew
this cookie value is supposed to be a signed version of this key.

3.
we stick this signed key on the user's browser.
When a user makes a request 
wqeuq9eu12786euiqwew -> sent to the server

4.
On a server it is unsigned/decrypted, using the secret we named
Then it is turning the cookie wqeuq9eu12786euiqwew -> qweqoeiqeqwi
So cookie -> our key

5.
Make a request to redis.
Look up the key in redis and get a data
    sess: qweqoeiqeqwi -> { userId: 1 }

We store that part on the request session.
req.session = { userId: 1 }
